Ask the user to enter a number for the height of the pyramid.
Keep asking the user until they enter a number between 1 and 8.
For each row of the pyramid, do the following:
a. Calculate the number of spaces to draw by subtracting the row number from the height of the pyramid, and then subtracting one more space.
b. Draw the spaces.
c. Calculate the number of blocks to draw by adding one block for every row number, plus one more block.
d. Draw the blocks.
e. Move to a new line to start drawing the next row.
Repeat step 3 until all rows of the pyramid have been drawn.
